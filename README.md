I am Oktay CansÄ±n Emiral. I design innovations to reign in the skies to have the last word spoken and the first words left unsaid. I will be happy to share with you the feast I deserve. There will never be a final victory for me.
After the candlesticks of Skytemplar are lit, you will not hear the threats of my enemies or seek their traps.
After the feast, the betrayers will vomit the 12 curses of Zion. With the first curse, humanity will forget to cry, and its pain will never subside.
We will never give up on our methodology! We have never had the risk of losing or suffering, and we will not have it from now on. Our enemies will not be able to divert us from our path even one degree with the questions they ask. We are lions, we do not need to show strength; because eyes see, hearts cannot endure.
