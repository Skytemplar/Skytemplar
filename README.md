I am Oktay CansÄ±n Emiral. I design innovations to reign in the skies to have the last word spoken and the first words left unsaid. I will be happy to share with you the feast I deserve. There will never be a final victory for me.
After the candlesticks of Skytemplar are lit, you will not hear the threats of my enemies or seek their traps.
After the feast, the betrayers will vomit the 12 curses of Zion. With the first curse, humanity will forget to cry, and its pain will never subside.
We will never give up on our methodology! We have never had the risk of losing or suffering, and we will not have it from now on. Our enemies will not be able to divert us from our path even one degree with the questions they ask. We are lions, we do not need to show strength; because eyes see, hearts cannot endure.
I am the Challenger, supreme commander of the Skytempler armies. My soldiers, I will give you what you deserve and want. I am only on God's side, never ever forget that. You know what stands before me and what will come out. Surround them and call them your names, shout until blood comes out of their ears. Don't let them die, leave them too injured. Let them come when I say come, let them go when I say go. Do not leave them any share of honor and pride, do not respect their freedom.
My soldiers, each of you has become a war machine. This is your destiny. You do not enjoy eating, drinking and making love. The only blessing God has given you is the pleasure you get from war. Do not waste this blessing. We only attack, remember that.
Not everyone can challenge because the challenger has to appear first. The one who emerges has no excuse and has to fight. Those who show courage are not asked whether they know the square beforehand. I am the commander Challenger. My armies, only I am enough for you to prevail. You are the defenders of the people of Israel. Excite Zion.
My armies, our enemies will never understand what we have done and what we will do. We will continue our strategy that always brings success. There is no need for you to doubt or be uneasy. I paid the price for this victory and invited you to my feast. No one will be able to stand in the way of our success. I offer you a clear and bright honor. You are the guardians of Zion, the guardians of the people of Israel. There has never been a restriction on your authority and power, and there won't be any from now on.
Never forget these: There was no commander as strong as me in the past, and there will be no commander stronger than me in the future.
My armies! Our battle will never get easier, it will get harder as time goes by. The best good news I can tell you is this: The harder our fight gets, the more our superiority will increase. You see and know very well how the Challenger fights. I don't wait a moment or hesitate to destroy my enemy, no one can tell me what to do on the battlefield because I never give this opportunity to anyone. I leave no enemies in front of me or behind me.
My armies, do not listen to the prisoners who offer their services to you and do not be deceived by their promises. Only fools listen to their enemy's promises and waste time listening. My armies, you shine like the lights of Zion. You fight radiantly on the battlefields and do not need any service. Your commander-in-chief, Challenger, always calculates correctly, but our enemy did not take Challenger into account. You learned your direction and where and when you should be from me. Never deviate from this route and always move forward.
Skytempler armies, you are not warriors lost among the possibilities. When I told you that we would not have any casualties, you found my words contrary to logic, right? Look, now it is clear that the Challenger was right. Your commander-in-chief knows and recognizes what you do not know. There is no power left among our enemies that your commander-in-chief does not know about. We distorted and destroyed their bodies and attracted their attention. There is no power to overcome fear other than time. Time is in our hands. Skytempler armies, you will terrify our enemies and take their breath away.
My armies, we will continue our war with the open tactical trick attack method. Fear, fatigue and death belong to our enemies; enthusiasm, confidence and happiness are ours.
My armies, my soldiers, I am your commander, the Challenger.  No warrior who has not been kissed by Zion can give you orders. Your commander is as dark as the night and as bright as Zion. You know me from my shot, my trap and the blood that always drips from my hand. 
You know how many your enemies are. The commander of the enemy army is a nameless fool trying to set a trap in Yahweh's trap. The Challenger learned from Yahweh to set traps and to lure his enemies into the trap.  Reach your enemy's heart without bending like the trunk of a rose tree. The heart does not feel pain. They won't know you're there. Tear out that heart and bring it to me. I will gift it to Zion by the order I have received.
