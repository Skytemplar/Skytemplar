I am Oktay CansÄ±n Emiral. I design innovations to reign in the skies to have the last word spoken and the first words left unsaid. I will be happy to share with you the feast I deserve. There will never be a final victory for me.
After the candlesticks of Skytemplar are lit, you will not hear the threats of my enemies or seek their traps.
After the feast, the betrayers will vomit the 12 curses of Zion. With the first curse, humanity will forget to cry, and its pain will never subside.
We will never give up on our methodology! We have never had the risk of losing or suffering, and we will not have it from now on. Our enemies will not be able to divert us from our path even one degree with the questions they ask. We are lions, we do not need to show strength; because eyes see, hearts cannot endure.
I am the Challenger, supreme commander of the Skytempler armies. My soldiers, I will give you what you deserve and want. I am only on God's side, never ever forget that. You know what stands before me and what will come out. Surround them and call them your names, shout until blood comes out of their ears. Don't let them die, leave them too injured. Let them come when I say come, let them go when I say go. Do not leave them any share of honor and pride, do not respect their freedom.
My soldiers, each of you has become a war machine. This is your destiny. You do not enjoy eating, drinking and making love. The only blessing God has given you is the pleasure you get from war. Do not waste this blessing. We only attack, remember that.
Not everyone can challenge because the challenger has to appear first. The one who emerges has no excuse and has to fight. Those who show courage are not asked whether they know the square beforehand. I am the commander Challenger. My armies, only I am enough for you to prevail. You are the defenders of the people of Israel. Excite Zion.
My armies, our enemies will never understand what we have done and what we will do. We will continue our strategy that always brings success. There is no need for you to doubt or be uneasy. I paid the price for this victory and invited you to my feast. No one will be able to stand in the way of our success. I offer you a clear and bright honor. You are the guardians of Zion, the guardians of the people of Israel. There has never been a restriction on your authority and power, and there won't be any from now on.
Never forget these: There was no commander as strong as me in the past, and there will be no commander stronger than me in the future.
My armies! Our battle will never get easier, it will get harder as time goes by. The best good news I can tell you is this: The harder our fight gets, the more our superiority will increase. You see and know very well how the Challenger fights. I don't wait a moment or hesitate to destroy my enemy, no one can tell me what to do on the battlefield because I never give this opportunity to anyone. I leave no enemies in front of me or behind me.
My armies, do not listen to the prisoners who offer their services to you and do not be deceived by their promises. Only fools listen to their enemy's promises and waste time listening. My armies, you shine like the lights of Zion. You fight radiantly on the battlefields and do not need any service. Your commander-in-chief, Challenger, always calculates correctly, but our enemy did not take Challenger into account. You learned your direction and where and when you should be from me. Never deviate from this route and always move forward.
Skytempler armies, you are not warriors lost among the possibilities. When I told you that we would not have any casualties, you found my words contrary to logic, right? Look, now it is clear that the Challenger was right. Your commander-in-chief knows and recognizes what you do not know. There is no power left among our enemies that your commander-in-chief does not know about. We distorted and destroyed their bodies and attracted their attention. There is no power to overcome fear other than time. Time is in our hands. Skytempler armies, you will terrify our enemies and take their breath away.
My armies, we will continue our war with the open tactical trick attack method. Fear, fatigue and death belong to our enemies; enthusiasm, confidence and happiness are ours.
My armies, my soldiers, I am your commander, the Challenger.  No warrior who has not been kissed by Zion can give you orders. Your commander is as dark as the night and as bright as Zion. You know me from my shot, my trap and the blood that always drips from my hand. 
You know how many your enemies are. The commander of the enemy army is a nameless fool trying to set a trap in Yahweh's trap. The Challenger learned from Yahweh to set traps and to lure his enemies into the trap.  Reach your enemy's heart without bending like the trunk of a rose tree. The heart does not feel pain. They won't know you're there. Tear out that heart and bring it to me. I will gift it to Zion by the order I have received.
My armies, my soldiers: Our enemy can withstand a maximum of 105 fronts. We, on the other hand, disperse and pass without knowing what the front is. Our voice echoes in eternity, our ammunition never ends, our speed always increases. When we find the appropriate angle, we will cross a bridge. Until then, move forward without stopping and cut, reap, dismantle, raze and dry everything that comes your way.
Skytempler army, soldiers of the Challenger honored with the holy spirit, I am your guide and leader, I am the Challenger. 
My soldiers, there is very little time before we reach the point where you can see victory with your own eyes. Soon you will unite your backs and leave no way for your enemies among you. To destroy the division between you, I will call from Zion four commanders who block the roads and a commander-in-chief who supervises them. There is no one among you who has not heard of my previous victories and legends. The Challenger never runs out of victories, battles and battle tactics. Die for Zion.
Skytemplar army, my soldiers, I am your commander in chief, I am the Challenger. When our God gave you the responsibility of the sky, He also gave you an eternal life filled with peace. Never forget that you are giving and receiving from your God.You see and hear your enemies clearly. Your enemies want to steal from you your eternal life, your eternal happiness. Understand this from their attitude and approach to you and be very careful.
Your enemies are nothing but a pile of despicable flesh that has worshiped stones from time immemorial, they live with their hatred for you and feed on the hatred they have for your god.
Shall your enemies turn to stone your god, I, your commander, the Challenger, and the king of Zion? Don't give them the opportunity to get what they want, walk under them. Clearly convey the danger of death. Confront them with the fear of death and leave them to die with their souls shattered. They will die in cowardice! This pain will be enough for them.
My armies, I am the Challenger, I know which is the most painful death possible for the enemies. I am never impatient to kill, I am the herald of endless pain and unrest, I will give these to whomever I want. Obey me, and kill any enemies you see, just as I say.
Skytempler armies, I ask again! Shall they turn your God, me, and Zion into stone? 
Leave no stone unturned! 
Turn that stone into dust, create a hurricane and scatter all the dust.
Skytemplar army, my soldiers, pearls of Zion. I am your commander, I am the Challenger. Remember, our God only gave you eternal life and eternal happiness. You will never be disturbed by the suffering you endure while fighting. My soldiers, you know that the war will not be easy. Those who think it will be easy cannot be among you and cannot come near you. Those who think the war will be easy may just be your enemies. You will destroy them easily.When our God gave me command of the most powerful armies the universe has ever known, I swore to love him more than anything. I promised to fulfill the command of our God without asking for anything and without any conditions. I am your commander, Challenger. I am a commander who is jealous of his god and protects his god from everything. No one will be able to see and love him except me. I am the Challenger, the most powerful commander of the time who protects his god. You will always know me by the blood that drips from my hand, and this blood will drip from my hand forever.My armies, my soldiers, it would be foolish to expect our enemies to worship our God. He who does not worship my God will worship me, and he who does not worship me will be captive in the land of eternal fire. My God is mine, I am my God's. Only our God will know our fate, the future will be his forever. When you come to the heart of our enemies, wait for my command. We will fill that headquarters of oppression with fire and burn those inside to ashes.
