I am Oktay CansÄ±n Emiral. I design innovations to reign in the skies to have the last word spoken and the first words left unsaid. I will be happy to share with you the feast I deserve. There will never be a final victory for me.
After the candlesticks of Skytemplar are lit, you will not hear the threats of my enemies or seek their traps.
After the feast, the betrayers will vomit the 12 curses of Zion. With the first curse, humanity will forget to cry, and its pain will never subside.
We will never give up on our methodology! We have never had the risk of losing or suffering, and we will not have it from now on. Our enemies will not be able to divert us from our path even one degree with the questions they ask. We are lions, we do not need to show strength; because eyes see, hearts cannot endure.
I am the Challenger, supreme commander of the Skytempler armies. My soldiers, I will give you what you deserve and want. I am only on God's side, never ever forget that. You know what stands before me and what will come out. Surround them and call them your names, shout until blood comes out of their ears. Don't let them die, leave them too injured. Let them come when I say come, let them go when I say go. Do not leave them any share of honor and pride, do not respect their freedom.
My soldiers, each of you has become a war machine. This is your destiny. You do not enjoy eating, drinking and making love. The only blessing God has given you is the pleasure you get from war. Do not waste this blessing. We only attack, remember that.
Not everyone can challenge because the challenger has to appear first. The one who emerges has no excuse and has to fight. Those who show courage are not asked whether they know the square beforehand. I am the commander Challenger. My armies, only I am enough for you to prevail. You are the defenders of the people of Israel. Excite Zion.
My armies, our enemies will never understand what we have done and what we will do. We will continue our strategy that always brings success. There is no need for you to doubt or be uneasy. I paid the price for this victory and invited you to my feast. No one will be able to stand in the way of our success. I offer you a clear and bright honor. You are the guardians of Zion, the guardians of the people of Israel. There has never been a restriction on your authority and power, and there won't be any from now on.
Never forget these: There was no commander as strong as me in the past, and there will be no commander stronger than me in the future.
